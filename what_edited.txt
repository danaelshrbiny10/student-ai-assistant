Student Assistant - Project Changes Summary (2026-01-28)

1) Backend authentication removal and Guest Mode (backend/app.py)
 - Removed all Flask-JWT-Extended usage (imports, configuration, decorators).
 - Imports: removed jwt imports; added Response import; simplified datetime import.
 - Configuration: removed JWT_SECRET_KEY and JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES settings.
 - Removed JWTManager initialization.
 - Added helper functions:
   * ensure_guest_user(): creates/persists a default guest user (email: guest@localhost) if missing.
   * get_guest_user_id(): returns the guest user id.
 - Ensured guest user exists at startup via app.app_context().
 - Updated auth endpoints to guest mode (no credentials):
   * POST /api/auth/register -> returns 201 with guest user and access_token: 'guest'.
   * POST /api/auth/login -> returns guest user and access_token: 'guest'.
   * GET /api/auth/me -> returns guest user info.
   * PUT /api/auth/update -> updates guest user preferences.
 - Removed all @jwt_required() decorators across the API.
 - Replaced get_jwt_identity() usage with get_guest_user_id() in all routes.
 - All features (tasks, documents, planner, habits, stats, general AI) now operate under the guest user.

2) CORS and local network support (backend/app.py)
 - Expanded allowed origins in CORS to include:
   http://localhost:3000, http://localhost:5000,
   http://127.0.0.1:3000, http://127.0.0.1:5000,
   http://192.168.1.3:3000, http://192.168.1.3:5000
 - This resolves cross-origin issues when accessing the app via localhost, 127.0.0.1, or a LAN IP.

3) Static asset fallbacks to prevent 404s (backend/app.py)
 - Added backend routes to serve minimal assets if not present in frontend:
   * GET /manifest.json -> returns a minimal web app manifest JSON.
   * GET /service-worker.js -> returns a stub service worker (install/activate no-ops).
 - Prevents 404s and service worker registration failures during development.

4) Dependencies (backend/requirements.noauth.txt)
 - Created a new file with auth-free dependencies:
   Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-CORS, google-generativeai,
   python-dotenv, PyPDF2, python-docx, werkzeug, pytz
 - Note: backend/requirements.txt still contains Flask-JWT-Extended and Flask-Migrate.
   You can either install from backend/requirements.noauth.txt or remove those two lines
   from backend/requirements.txt to unify.

5) Unchanged files
 - backend/database.py: no changes to models or initialization.
 - backend/ai_new.py: no changes to AI service logic.
 - frontend/: no code changes. Frontend benefits from new backend routes for manifest and service worker.

6) Behavior notes
 - The default guest user is persisted in the database; account info (name, email, created_at)
   is returned by GET /api/auth/me and can be displayed in the UI.
 - All endpoints continue to function without authentication under the single guest user context.
