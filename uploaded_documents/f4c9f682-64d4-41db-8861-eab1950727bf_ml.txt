Title: Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

1. Supervised Learning:
   - The model is trained on labeled data.
   - Examples include classification (e.g., spam detection) and regression (e.g., predicting house prices).

2. Unsupervised Learning:
   - The model finds patterns in unlabeled data.
   - Examples include clustering (e.g., customer segmentation) and dimensionality reduction.

3. Reinforcement Learning:
   - The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
   - Commonly used in robotics, gaming, and navigation tasks.

Key Concepts:
- Features: Input variables used by the model.
- Labels: Output variables we want to predict.
- Training: The process of teaching the model.
- Testing: Evaluating the model's performance on unseen data.

Remember, preprocessing data and selecting the right model are crucial steps in achieving good performance.
